## What is Typescript?

Typescript (TS) is a superset of Javascript (JS), which means that almost any JS
code is also TS code, but the inverse is not true.

What is the difference? Well, JS is a dynamically typed language which means
that you can assign different types to the same variable.

```js
// Javascript does not care about types.

const value = 19;

value = "hello there";

value = true;
```

But on the other hand...

```ts
// Typescript does.

const value = 19;

// Error here, value is of type number and cannot be assigned a string.
value = "hello there";
```

This is great because it prevents us from making dumb mistakes by checking them
at _"compile"_ time. Typescript provides a lot of other handy checks and
validations to help us when writing code, but the important part is that since
TS only helps us when developing, when we _"compile"_ our code, any
TS is now gone and only javascript remains. This is because the browsers cannot
run TS natively .... yet!

Due to the fact that my explanations are not the best and that english is not my
first language, I highly encourage you to watch some videos made by people way
smarter than me:

- [fireship's typescript video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQnBQ4tB3ZA)
- [Jack Herrington's every day types video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKVHFHJsiO0)

## How to get started?

Well, in order to get started you just need to have installed the following
tools:

- Nodejs
- Npm, Yarn or Pnpm
- Some text editor (VSCode, Neovim, Sublime, etc...)

### Creating project

Once you have those installed, you will need a testing directory. Create a new
folder and name it whatever you want, mine will be called **ts-testing**.

Now we need to initialize a **package.json**, to do so run:

```bash
# Depending on which node package manager you have chosen, do

npm init

# or

yarn init

# or

pnpm init
```

### Installing dependencies

Then create a main.ts file, this could be any name, but main or index are
usually the convention you will want to use.

In order to get started we will need to install a few dependencies which will
help us to run typescript with the node engine.

```bash
npm i -D typescript ts-node ts-node-dev @types/node

# or

yarn add -D typescript ts-node ts-node-dev @types/node

# or

pnpm add -D typescript ts-node ts-node-dev @types/node
```

#### Why?

- typescript: to get typescript support
- ts-node: to run typescript files in node
- ts-node-dev: to rerun the ts-node command when the file changes
- @types/node: to get the nodejs types for typescript

### Results

```json
// package.json
{
  "name": "ts-testing",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {},
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/node": "^17.0.35",
    "ts-node": "^10.8.0",
    "ts-node-dev": "^1.1.8",
    "typescript": "^4.7.2"
  }
}
```

The resulting directory structure should be the following one:

```
node_modules/
main.ts
package.json
pnpm-lock.yaml
```

> keep in mind that I used pnpm to start this project, if you used a different
> tool, the **pnpm-lock.yaml** may be **yarn.lock** or **package-lock.json**

## Final steps

Add the following scripts to make the development easier:

```json
// package.json
{
  "name": "ts-testing",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  // Add this scripts
  "scripts": {
    // start will run the file main.ts onece
    "start": "ts-node main.ts",
    // dev will re-run the file main.ts every time it is changed
    "dev": "ts-node-dev --respawn main.ts"
  }
  // ... rest of file ...
}
```

now running **pnpm dev** or **yarn dev** or **npm run dev** should run the
main.ts file.

No output? Well, we haven't written anything in the file yet! Add the following
to test if it is working:

```ts
console.log("hello world!");
```

Now it should output **hello world** to the console!! Finally, your typescript
sandbox is done, you can now start practicing typescript.
